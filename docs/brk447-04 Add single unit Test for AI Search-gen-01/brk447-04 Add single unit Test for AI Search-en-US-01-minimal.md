1. State the task to implement unit tests for the AI search endpoints. [00:00:02.400]
2. Inspect the codebase and identify missing tests and affected endpoints (AI search and formal search). [00:00:13.120]
3. Switch Copilot to agent mode and open a new chat. [00:00:34.360]
4. Select the "AI Search" context and choose the desired model (e.g., GPT-5). [00:00:47.320]
5. Use the hashtag/task selector to choose "implement unit tests" and confirm the AI Search scope. [00:01:09.560]
6. Allow Copilot to read the solution and start analyzing the code. [00:01:31.870]
7. Wait while Copilot generates test files and code, then attempts a build. [00:01:31.870]
8. Inspect build failure messages and let Copilot add missing dependencies. [00:02:56.040]
9. Rebuild the solution and confirm the build succeeds with the new tests added. [00:02:56.040]
10. Accept Copilot's code changes in the editor. [00:03:24.304]
11. Open Test Explorer and run all tests to verify the new "products AI" tests are listed and passing. [00:03:24.304]
12. Prepare to expand the request to check and implement missing unit tests across the entire solution. [00:03:58.600]
