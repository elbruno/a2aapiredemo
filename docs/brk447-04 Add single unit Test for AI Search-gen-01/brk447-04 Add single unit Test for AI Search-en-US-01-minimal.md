1. Identify endpoints missing unit tests (AI search and formal search) in the solution workspace. [00:00:02.400]  
2. Switch Copilot to agent mode and create a new chat session. [00:00:41.560]  
3. Select the AI search context in the chat and choose the GPT-5 model. [00:00:41.560]  
4. Trigger the task by typing a hashtag plus the task name and select the "implement unit tests" quick action for AI search. [00:01:09.560]  
5. Allow Copilot to read the solution, generate test code, and perform iterative builds. [00:01:21.105]  
6. Wait for Copilot to modify dependencies and rebuild until the build completes. [00:01:21.105]  
7. Review and accept Copilot’s generated unit test changes. [00:02:56.040]  
8. Open the Test Explorer and run the tests, verifying the new "products AI test" cases are present and passing. [00:02:56.040]  
9. Request a broader solution-wide check for missing unit tests if needed. [00:03:58.600]
