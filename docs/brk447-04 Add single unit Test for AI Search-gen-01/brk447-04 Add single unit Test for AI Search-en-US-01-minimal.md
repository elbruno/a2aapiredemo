1. State the goal: implement unit tests for the AI search endpoint. [00:00:02.400]
2. Review the endpoints and identify missing tests for the AI search and formal search. [00:00:13.120]
3. Switch Copilot to Agent mode and create a new chat. [00:00:34.360]
4. Select the AI Search context and choose the desired model (e.g., GPT-5). [00:00:34.360]
5. Use a hashtag quick action like "#implement unit tests" to invoke test generation. [00:00:34.360]
6. Let Copilot analyze the solution, generate new test code, and iterate while it attempts builds. [00:01:27.760]
7. Observe build failures, add any missing dependencies, and rebuild the solution. [00:02:56.040]
8. Accept the generated code changes after a successful build. [00:03:19.000]
9. Open Test Explorer and run the new tests or Run All Tests. [00:03:19.000]
10. Request Copilot to check the entire solution for any remaining missing tests. [00:03:19.000]
