1. Note the local unit test implementation and decide to delegate any missing tests to a cloud-isolated agent. [00:00:00.160]  
2. Create an issue describing the missing unit tests and enable GitHub tools/Copilot integration. [00:00:16.461]  
3. Allow the GitHub search tool to run and search repository issues for "missing unit tests" to find existing reports. [00:00:40.978]  
4. Open the identified issue (e.g., issue #18) and review the scope, acceptance criteria, and task list. [00:01:14.240]  
5. Assign Copilot to the issue using the GitHub UI or Visual Studio integration. [00:01:38.680]  
6. Refresh the issue to confirm Copilot pickup, then open the pull request created by Copilot and view the session steps (environment creation, fork, repo checkout). [00:02:02.600]  
7. Open the PR "Files changed" diff and examine the added unit test files for products, store, and frontend, and review the session log and duration. [00:03:02.360]  
8. Open the GitHub Actions run for the PR and inspect the full action logs for CI execution details. [00:03:55.400]
