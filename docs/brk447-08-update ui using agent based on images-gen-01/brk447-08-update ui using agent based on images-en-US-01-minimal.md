1. Copy the SAVA style files and reference images from the repository. [00:00:25.120]  
2. Open GitHub Copilot / Compiler and paste the style files and images into the compiler context. [00:00:25.120]  
3. Send a prompt asking the compiler to apply the SAVA brand styles to the Blazor front-end. [00:00:25.120]  
4. Allow Copilot to scan the repository (CSS and .razor component files) and generate an implementation plan. [00:01:09.380]  
5. Approve or trigger Copilot’s edits to app.css and any other style files. [00:02:09.720]  
6. If a popup requests stopping the running application, accept and stop the app to allow changes. [00:02:09.720]  
7. Restart/run the Blazor application and refresh the browser to view the applied changes. [00:02:09.720]  
8. If visual issues persist, take a screenshot of the problematic UI and paste it into Copilot with a concise improvement request. [00:03:03.040]  
9. Wait for Copilot to analyze the screenshot and implement further CSS or component edits. [00:03:03.040]  
10. Rerun the application and refresh the page to observe iterative updates. [00:03:56.709]  
11. Test the product page and product cards by adding items to the cart and inspect layout and readability. [00:03:56.709]  
12. Repeat screenshot-driven prompts and Copilot-driven edits until the SAVA styles and UI layout are satisfactory. [00:05:04.920]
