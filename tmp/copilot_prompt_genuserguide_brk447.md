Generate a Markdown guide for session BRK-447, which covers a real-world scenario using Visual Studio and GitHub Copilot.
Use the repository files as context.

The guide should instruct the speaker to:
1. Review the 'Initial Setup.md' file to prepare all required resources.
2. Create an issue in GitHub and assign it to the Coding Agent.
3. Execute a PRD, ensuring the PRD is downloadable for integration into the repository.
4. Follow the slide deck and demo videos.

For the final step, include references and links to the Markdown notes located in each video demo folder.
Make the guide useful and easy to follow for a technical presenter.
